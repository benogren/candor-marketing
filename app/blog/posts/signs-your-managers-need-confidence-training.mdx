title: '5 Signs Your Managers Need Confidence Training'

summary: 'How to spot the warning signals before poor management costs you top talent and team performance'
---

Lisa Rodriguez, Head of People Operations at a 400-person marketing agency, noticed the pattern during quarterly reviews. Three different department heads kept asking the same question: "Can you help me handle this situation with my team?" Whether it was a performance issue, a conflict between team members, or a career development conversation, her managers consistently escalated people challenges to HR instead of handling them directly.

"I realized our managers weren't just busy—they were avoiding the core responsibilities of management because they didn't feel confident," Lisa recalls. "The warning signs were everywhere, but we'd been interpreting them as individual performance issues rather than a systemic confidence problem."

Sound familiar? You're not alone. [Research shows that 85% of managers receive no training before promotion](https://makedaandrews.com/why-managers-fail-6-reasons-many-first-time-managers-dont-succeed/), leaving them to figure out leadership through trial and error—often at the expense of team performance and employee retention.

The good news? Manager confidence issues follow predictable patterns. By recognizing these five warning signs early, you can intervene with targeted support before minor confidence gaps become major performance problems.

## Sign #1: They Avoid Difficult Conversations

### The Behavior You'll Notice

When managers lack confidence, difficult conversations become their kryptonite. You'll see them:

- **Postponing performance discussions** for weeks or months
- **Sending lengthy emails** instead of having face-to-face conversations
- **Avoiding direct feedback** about behavior or performance issues
- **Escalating conflicts to HR** rather than addressing them with team members
- **Making excuses** for poor performers instead of coaching them

"I had one manager who sent me a 12-paragraph email asking for help with an underperforming team member," says Jennifer Park, VP of Human Resources at a SaaS company. "When I suggested he just talk to the person directly, he admitted he'd been avoiding the conversation for three months because he 'didn't know what to say.'"

### Why This Happens

[Research shows that 40% of managers struggle with difficult conversations](https://trainingindustry.com/articles/leadership/how-to-set-first-time-managers-up-for-succss/), often because they fear:

- Making the situation worse
- Being seen as confrontational or mean
- Not having the right words or framework
- Damaging relationships with team members
- Receiving pushback or emotional reactions

### The Impact on Your Organization

When managers avoid difficult conversations, problems compound:

- **Performance issues escalate** instead of being addressed early
- **Team members lose respect** for indecisive leadership
- **Top performers get frustrated** watching poor performance go unaddressed
- **HR gets overwhelmed** with issues that should be handled at the manager level
- **Company culture suffers** as accountability becomes optional

**Red Flag Example:** A talented engineer at a fintech company quit after watching her manager ignore a team member's consistently missed deadlines for six months. Her exit interview revealed: "If leadership won't address obvious problems, how can I trust them with my career development?"

## Sign #2: They Micromanage or Go Completely Hands-Off

### The Behavior You'll Notice

Manager confidence issues often manifest in extreme management styles—either controlling everything or providing no guidance at all:

**Micromanagement signals:**
- Requiring approval for routine decisions
- Checking in multiple times per day on simple tasks
- Redoing work that team members have completed
- Insisting on being copied on all team communications
- Monitoring work hours obsessively rather than focusing on outcomes

**Hands-off signals:**
- Rarely checking in on project progress
- Providing vague or confusing instructions
- Being unavailable when team members need guidance
- Failing to provide feedback on completed work
- Avoiding one-on-one meetings or keeping them superficial

### Why This Happens

Both extremes stem from the same root cause: uncertainty about how to provide appropriate oversight and support. Confident managers strike a balance, but inexperienced managers default to:

- **Micromanaging** because they don't trust the team (or themselves) to handle things properly
- **Hands-off management** because they don't know how to add value without being controlling

"I oscillated between both extremes in my first management role," admits David Chen, now a successful VP of Engineering. "I'd micromanage when I was anxious about deadlines, then swing to completely hands-off when I felt like I was being too controlling. My team never knew which version of me they'd get."

### The Impact on Your Organization

Both management extremes destroy team performance:

**Micromanagement effects:**
- Talented employees leave for roles with more autonomy
- Team members stop thinking critically and wait for directions
- Innovation decreases as people fear making mistakes
- Productivity drops as bottlenecks form around the manager

**Hands-off effects:**
- Projects lack direction and miss deadlines
- Team members feel unsupported and directionless
- Quality suffers without appropriate feedback and guidance
- Newer employees struggle without mentorship

**Red Flag Example:** A marketing team's productivity dropped 35% when their new manager started requiring approval for every social media post, email campaign, and client interaction. When he swung to the opposite extreme and stopped providing feedback entirely, three team members requested transfers within two months.

## Sign #3: They Can't Articulate Their Team's Development Needs

### The Behavior You'll Notice

During performance reviews, career development discussions, or team planning meetings, these managers:

- **Give vague responses** about team members' career goals
- **Provide generic development suggestions** like "improve communication"
- **Can't explain specific skills** each team member needs to advance
- **Seem surprised** when employees express career aspirations
- **Default to company-wide training** rather than personalized development plans
- **Focus only on current job performance** rather than growth potential

[Gartner research reveals that managers spend only 9% of their time on employee development](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/fine-tune-development-spend-to-make-managers-more-effective), yet this is one of the most critical functions for retention and engagement.

### Why This Happens

Many managers avoid development conversations because they:

- Don't know how to assess team members' growth potential
- Lack frameworks for identifying skill gaps
- Fear making promises about promotions they can't guarantee
- Feel unqualified to guide others' careers when they're still figuring out their own
- Haven't received training on career development coaching

"I realized I was failing my team when someone submitted a resignation letter citing 'lack of growth opportunities,'" says Maria Santos, a operations manager. "I'd been so focused on day-to-day tasks that I never asked about their career goals or discussed their development needs."

### The Impact on Your Organization

When managers can't support career development:

- **Top talent leaves** for companies that invest in their growth
- **Engagement scores drop** as employees feel stuck in their roles
- **Succession planning fails** because no one is being prepared for advancement
- **Skill gaps widen** as training focuses on immediate needs rather than future capabilities
- **Retention costs skyrocket** as replacing experienced employees becomes constant

**Red Flag Example:** A software company lost five senior developers in six months to competitors offering similar salaries but stronger development programs. Exit interviews revealed that none of them had ever discussed career growth with their manager beyond annual review checkbox exercises.

## Sign #4: They Focus on Activities Instead of Outcomes

### The Behavior You'll Notice

These managers obsess over the wrong metrics:

- **Monitoring login/logout times** rather than project completion
- **Counting hours worked** instead of value delivered
- **Tracking meeting attendance** rather than contribution quality
- **Measuring response times** instead of communication effectiveness
- **Focusing on busy work** rather than strategic priorities

This becomes especially problematic in remote and hybrid work environments where presence-based management fails completely.

### Why This Happens

Activity-focused management often stems from:

- **Lack of clarity** about what outcomes actually matter
- **Comfort with traditional management** approaches that worked in office settings
- **Fear of losing control** in remote work environments
- **Inability to measure impact** of knowledge work
- **Pressure to show management activity** even when it doesn't add value

"I caught myself asking team members to send daily activity reports because I couldn't see them working," admits Ryan Kim, a project manager who struggled with remote team leadership. "I was measuring everything except what actually mattered—whether we were delivering quality work on time."

### The Impact on Your Organization

Activity-focused management destroys productivity and morale:

- **Employee frustration increases** as time gets wasted on reporting instead of work
- **Real performance issues** get missed while managers focus on superficial metrics
- **Innovation decreases** as people optimize for looking busy rather than thinking creatively
- **Remote work effectiveness** plummets as managers try to recreate office oversight
- **Trust erodes** between managers and team members

**Red Flag Example:** A design team's productivity dropped 25% when their manager implemented daily time-tracking reports and required Slack status updates every two hours. Meanwhile, the team missed a major client deadline because no one was focusing on the actual project deliverables.

## Sign #5: They Escalate Everything to HR

### The Behavior You'll Notice

These managers treat HR as their first line of defense for any people-related challenge:

- **Immediately involving HR** in minor interpersonal conflicts
- **Asking HR to deliver feedback** they should give directly
- **Requesting HR attendance** at routine team discussions
- **Seeking permission** for basic management decisions
- **Forwarding employee questions** to HR instead of addressing them

While HR should handle serious issues like harassment, discrimination, or legal matters, confident managers handle day-to-day people management independently.

### Why This Happens

Over-reliance on HR typically indicates:

- **Lack of training** in fundamental management skills
- **Fear of making mistakes** that could have legal consequences
- **Uncertainty about authority** and decision-making boundaries
- **Avoidance of conflict** or difficult situations
- **Imposter syndrome** about their management capabilities

"I had a manager who would CC me on every email to their team members because they wanted 'documentation,'" says Amanda Foster, an HR Director. "What they actually needed was confidence in their ability to communicate directly with their team."

### The Impact on Your Organization

HR over-dependence creates multiple problems:

- **HR team gets overwhelmed** with issues that don't require their expertise
- **Management skill development stagnates** because managers don't practice essential skills
- **Team relationships suffer** as employees lose trust in their manager's authority
- **Decision-making slows** as everything requires multiple approvals
- **Organizational efficiency decreases** as simple issues become complex processes

**Red Flag Example:** An HR team at a mid-sized company spent 40% of their time on manager-escalated issues that could have been resolved with basic coaching conversations. This prevented them from focusing on strategic initiatives like talent acquisition and retention programs.

## What to Do When You Spot These Signs

Recognizing these warning signs is the first step. Here's how to intervene effectively:

### Immediate Interventions

**1. Provide Targeted Coaching**
- Pair struggling managers with experienced mentors
- Offer specific skill training for areas like difficult conversations or performance management
- Create safe practice environments for trying new approaches

**2. Clarify Expectations and Authority**
- Define what decisions managers can make independently
- Establish clear escalation guidelines for HR involvement
- Provide frameworks for common management situations

**3. Implement Regular Check-ins**
- Schedule weekly coaching sessions during the first 90 days
- Review specific management challenges and solutions
- Celebrate progress and address ongoing concerns

### Long-term Solutions

**1. Comprehensive Manager Development Program**
- Combine formal training with experiential learning
- Focus on practical skills like feedback delivery and career coaching
- Include peer learning opportunities with other managers

**2. Management Support Systems**
- Create manager communities of practice for ongoing support
- Develop internal resources and toolkits for common situations
- Establish clear pathways for getting help without over-dependence

**3. Regular Assessment and Feedback**
- Implement 360-degree feedback for all managers
- Track team performance metrics as indicators of management effectiveness
- Adjust development programs based on ongoing needs assessment

### Measuring Success

Track these metrics to ensure your interventions are working:

- **Team engagement scores** improving under each manager
- **Employee retention rates** stabilizing or increasing
- **HR escalation frequency** decreasing for routine management issues
- **Manager confidence surveys** showing improved self-efficacy
- **Business results** improving as teams become more effective

## The Bottom Line: Confidence Can Be Built

Manager confidence issues aren't character flaws—they're skill gaps that can be addressed with the right support and development. The organizations that recognize these warning signs early and invest in targeted interventions see remarkable improvements in both manager effectiveness and team performance.

Remember: every great manager started as someone who felt unprepared. The difference between struggling and succeeding often comes down to whether they receive the support and training needed to build confidence in their essential management capabilities.
