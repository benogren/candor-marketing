Last week, 80 of Silicon Valley's top HR leaders gathered in San Francisco for an eye-opening discussion about the future of performance management. What they revealed should fundamentally change how every organization thinks about feedback, ratings, and employee development.

The insights, captured in a new [Forbes article by Tarun Galagali](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tarungalagali/2025/06/30/ai--the-future-of-performance-management/), expose why traditional performance management is broken—and point toward a radically different future powered by AI.

## Breakthrough #1: Your Top Performers Are Judging You on Your Worst Ones

Jennifer Rettig, Chief People Officer at Pendo, discovered something shocking in their latest engagement surveys. While leaders expected complaints about compensation or career development, a different theme dominated: **accountability**.

> "Your top employees don't want to be saddled with teammates who aren't engaged, who aren't doing their work, who may be quietly quitting."

**The revelation:** High performers aren't looking for more perks—they're watching how quickly you address poor performance. Organizations that hold managers accountable for managing underperformers actually see **higher engagement** from their best people.

**What this means for your feedback strategy:** Your 360° process needs to surface performance issues faster, giving managers the data they need to make timely decisions about team composition.

## Breakthrough #2: Numerical Ratings Are Fighting Human Psychology (And Losing)

Gianna Driver, former Chief People Officer at Lattice, cited research that should make every HR leader reconsider their rating system:

> "We as humans are neurologically hardwired to evaluate people more in relative terms, less so in absolute numerical terms."

Yet most organizations persist with complex scoring matrices that fight against how our brains actually work. Forward-thinking companies are moving toward simplified frameworks like "on track/off track" that focus on **clarity and momentum** rather than numerical precision.

**The implication:** Your feedback collection should generate insights that align with human psychology, not force managers into unnatural evaluation frameworks.

## Breakthrough #3: AI Isn't About Automation—It's About Scaling Empathy

The most compelling AI applications described by these leaders weren't about efficiency—they were about **scaling human connection**.

Kelli Dragovich from Quizlet articulated the vision: "If you can scale yourself to be everywhere and anywhere when people need it in the flow of their work, that's where you can create a ton of value."

Danny Guillory from Glassdoor emphasized that this requires unprecedented transparency: "If you tell them as much as you can within legal and ethical bounds, that makes AI initiatives much easier."

**The transformation:** AI's highest value lies in making every employee feel more seen and supported, not in reducing human touchpoints.

## Breakthrough #4: Engagement Isn't a Program—It's Your Company's DNA

Tiffany Stevenson from WeightWatchers challenged the entire framework around employee engagement initiatives:

> "It becomes like a project or an initiative instead of just an expression of your identity as a company, as a brand."

She advocates for embedding engagement principles into every operational decision: "Looking at it as a series of micro decisions that you make every day—from who you hire to how you develop people to how you talk about your values."

**The shift:** Stop running engagement surveys and start making engagement-driven decisions in your performance management process.

## Breakthrough #5: Your Best Performance Data Is Hiding in Plain Sight

The most innovative insights aren't coming from traditional surveys—they're emerging from **organizational network analysis**.

Danny Guillory shared a powerful example: "I crossed different data points—Slack connections, email connections, and 360 review requests. About 80% of the results were people I could have predicted, but 20% were people I'd never heard of who turned out to be incredible connectors."

**The opportunity:** The most valuable performance data already exists in your organization's digital interactions. The question is whether you're sophisticated enough to find it and act on it.

## The Future Is Here: From Manual to Magical

These insights reveal why traditional 360° feedback processes feel so broken:

- **Manual reviewer selection** based on org charts misses actual working relationships
- **Point-in-time surveys** capture only a snapshot, missing ongoing collaboration patterns  
- **Administrative burden** (210+ hours annually per manager) prevents focus on actual coaching
- **Recency bias** skews feedback toward recent events rather than comprehensive performance

The solution isn't incremental improvement—it's a complete reimagining of how feedback works.

## What AI-Powered 360° Feedback Actually Looks Like

Imagine a system that:

- **Automatically identifies** who actually works with whom based on meeting patterns, communication frequency, and project collaboration
- **Generates contextual questions** tailored to specific relationships and interaction types
- **Collects feedback continuously** in the background, eliminating the dreaded "feedback season"
- **Synthesizes insights** that focus on growth opportunities rather than numerical scores
- **Provides managers** with comprehensive context for meaningful performance conversations

This isn't future technology—it's available now. And the results speak for themselves:

- **39% higher effectiveness** in talent attraction
- **44% better retention rates**  
- **80% reduction** in administrative time
- **71% increase** in employee engagement

## The Choice Every Organization Faces

As Jennifer Rettig noted: "Can you grow to be whatever the next thing or phase of your business is with the same amount of people that you have today? What more can you do with what you have today with the help of AI?"

The organizations thriving in this transformation aren't using AI to reduce headcount—they're using it to dramatically increase the quality and personalization of people support.

**The bottom line:** You can either keep fighting human psychology with manual processes that consume hundreds of hours and generate limited insights, or you can embrace AI-powered feedback that scales empathy and makes every performance conversation more meaningful.

The transformation is already underway among Silicon Valley's most innovative companies. 

The question isn't whether this change is coming—it's whether you'll lead it or be swept along by it.
