The average manager spends 210 hours each year on performance reviews. That's over 5 weeks of full-time work—just on administrative feedback processes.

# What if that number could be reduced to nearly zero?

## The Burden of Manual Feedback Collection:

The traditional feedback process is fundamentally broken:
- HR teams spend weeks setting up review cycles
- Managers struggle identifying the right reviewers
- Employees receive incomplete or biased assessments
- Everyone dreads the administrative overhead

## This changes everything:

Imagine feedback that happens automatically, running seamlessly in the background of your organization, with:
- No manual reviewer selection: AI identifies actual working relationships based on collaboration patterns
- No survey creation: Contextual surveys generated automatically based on relationship type and role
- No chasing responses: Feedback collected continuously throughout the year, not just during review season
- No manual synthesis: AI summarizes trends, patterns, and development needs in seconds

## The results are transformative:

For HR leaders:
- 80% reduction in administrative time
- Higher completion rates
- More comprehensive data for talent decisions

For managers:
- Hundreds of hours saved annually
- Better prepared for meaningful development conversations
- Reduced recency bias in performance assessment

For employees:
- More balanced, complete feedback
- Regular input from actual collaborators
- Clearer path to development and growth

The future of HR isn't about doing more with less—it's about automation doing more so people can focus on what matters.

With 58% of companies still using basic spreadsheets for performance tracking, the opportunity for competitive advantage is massive. Organizations implementing automated feedback systems are experiencing 39% higher talent attraction and 44% better retention rates.

The question isn't whether automation will transform HR feedback processes, but who will benefit first.

Is your organization still manually collecting feedback, or are you ready to embrace the zero-effort future?
